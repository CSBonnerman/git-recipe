        <h3>I’ve made a few variations of pasta sauce over the years, but this Slow Cooker Spaghetti Sauce is definitely one of my favorites. The long slow simmer caramelizes the sugars in the tomatoes and creates a depth of flavor that can’t be matched. Plus, what more could you ask for than to just throw some ingredients in a pot, forget about it for 8 hours, and then come back to a rich, delicious homemade sauce? Then you can divide the sauce into portions, freeze, and you’ll have delicious homemade pasta sauce on hand for quick busy weeknight dinners.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>2 28oz. cans crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 6oz. can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp dried basil</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Place both in a 3 quart or larger slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar, and butter to the slow cooker. Stir everything together well.</li>
            <li>Place the lid on the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours or low for eight hours.</li>
            <li>After cooking, give it a good stir, then add salt to taste. Start with just ½ tsp of salt and add more if needed (I added 1 tsp). Use the sauce immediately, refrigerate, or freeze for later.</li>
        </ol>
