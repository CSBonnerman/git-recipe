        <h3>Cinnamon toast is made with just four ingredients: bread, butter, sugar, and cinnamon. I’ve discovered that the trick to cinnamon toast perfection is making sweetened cinnamon butter with a few drops of vanilla. CAN’T I JUST USE MY TOASTER? Unfortunately, you cannot achieve this heightened level of yum by simply toasting your bread, buttering it, and sprinkling it with cinnamon and sugar. You’ll only have flavor on the top of your toast, not throughout, and while it will be good, it won’t be BEYOND. And don’t we all need a little BEYOND in our lives?</h3>

            <li>Spread half of the butter on one side of your slice of bread. Make sure to cover the slice from corner to corner.</li>
